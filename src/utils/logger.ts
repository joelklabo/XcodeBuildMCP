/**
 * Logger Utility - Simple logging implementation for the application
 *
 * This utility module provides a lightweight logging system that directs log
 * messages to stderr rather than stdout, ensuring they don't interfere with
 * the MCP protocol communication which uses stdout.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Formatting log messages with timestamps and level indicators
 * - Directing all logs to stderr to avoid MCP protocol interference
 * - Supporting different log levels (info, warning, error, debug)
 * - Providing a simple, consistent logging interface throughout the application
 * - Sending error-level logs to Sentry for monitoring and alerting
 *
 * While intentionally minimal, this logger provides the essential functionality
 * needed for operational monitoring and debugging throughout the application.
 * It's used by virtually all other modules for status reporting and error logging.
