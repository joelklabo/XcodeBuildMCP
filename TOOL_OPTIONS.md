# XcodeBuildMCP Tool Options

This document explains how to configure tool registration in XcodeBuildMCP to optimise for different workflows and reduce the number of tools presented to LLM clients.

## Overview

XcodeBuildMCP supports selective tool registration based on environment variables. This allows you to:

1. **Opt-in to individual tools** - Enable only specific tools you need
2. **Enable tool groups** - Enable logical groups of tools for specific workflows
3. **Default "all tools enabled"** - Without any configuration, all tools are enabled (default behaviour)

## Why Use Selective Tool Registration?

- **Reduced context window usage for LLMs** - Only register tools needed for a specific workflow
- **Optimised for different use cases** - Configure for iOS development, macOS development, UI testing, etc.

## Available Tool Groups and Environment Variables

XcodeBuildMCP provides workflow-based tool groups that organise tools logically based on common developer workflows.

### Workflow-based Groups

These groups organise tools based on common developer workflows, making it easier to enable just the tools needed for specific tasks:

- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_PROJECT_DISCOVERY=true** - Project/target discovery and analysis tools
  - _e.g., Discover projects, list schemes, show build settings._
- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_IOS_SIMULATOR_WORKFLOW=true** - Complete iOS simulator development workflow tools
  - _e.g., Building, running, debugging on simulators._
- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_IOS_DEVICE_WORKFLOW=true** - iOS physical device development workflow tools
  - _e.g., Building and deploying to physical iOS devices._
- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_MACOS_WORKFLOW=true** - macOS application development workflow tools
  - _e.g., Building, running, debugging macOS applications._
- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_SIMULATOR_MANAGEMENT=true** - Simulator device management tools
  - _e.g., Managing simulator lifecycle (boot, open, set appearance)._
- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_APP_DEPLOYMENT=true** - Application deployment tools
  - _e.g., Installing and launching apps across platforms._
- **XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_DIAGNOSTICS=true** - Logging and diagnostics tools

## Recommended Tool Combinations for Common Use Cases

Workflow-based groups make it easier to enable just the right tools for specific development tasks. Here are some recommended combinations:

### iOS Simulator Developer

For developers focussed on iOS simulator development:

```json
{
  // Rest of your MCP configuration
  "env": {
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_PROJECT_DISCOVERY": "true",
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_IOS_SIMULATOR_WORKFLOW": "true"
  }
  // Rest of your MCP configuration
}
```

This provides all tools needed to:
1. Discover and analyse projects
2. Build for iOS simulators
3. Install and launch on simulators
4. Capture logs

### macOS Application Developer

For developers focussed on macOS application development:

```json
{
  // Rest of your MCP configuration
  "env": {
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_PROJECT_DISCOVERY": "true",
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_MACOS_WORKFLOW": "true"
  }
  // Rest of your MCP configuration
}
```

This provides all tools needed to:
1. Discover and analyse projects
2. Build for macOS
3. Launch macOS applications

### UI Automation Testing

For developers focussed on UI automation testing:

```json
{
  // Rest of your MCP configuration
  "env": {
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_UI_TESTING": "true",
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_SIMULATOR_MANAGEMENT": "true",
    "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_APP_DEPLOYMENT": "true"
  }
  // Rest of your MCP configuration
}
```

This provides tools for:
1. Managing simulators
2. Installing and launching apps
3. Running UI automation tests

## Example Cursor/Windsurf Configuration

Here is a fully worked example of how to configure Cursor/Windsurf to use specific tool groups:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "XcodeBuildMCP": {
      "command": "mise",
      "args": [
        "x",
        "npm:xcodebuildmcp@1.3.6",
        "--",
        "xcodebuildmcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_PROJECT_DISCOVERY": "true",
        "XCODEBUILDMCP_GROUP_IOS_SIMULATOR_WORKFLOW": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This example configures the MCP client to only enable tools related to iOS simulator development.
